# Isa Kaya  
**Front End Engineer | React • TypeScript • Next.js • TailwindCSS**

I build reliable, scalable, and maintainable front-end applications using modern React and TypeScript ecosystems.  
My work focuses on data-intensive dashboards, admin panels, CMS platforms, and EV telemetry tools.  
GitHub contains my personal and side projects, while my professional work remains private due to company policies.
